# Effective Drug Dosage Monitoring Method for Immune Systems Using Reinforcement Learning

This project presents an intelligent system for optimizing drug dosage for cancer immunotherapy using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The method focuses on dynamically adjusting drug doses to control tumor growth while maintaining a healthy immune cell count, even under uncertain biological conditions and dosage constraints.

## 🧠 Abstract

The system applies RL techniques to model and control the immune system response against tumors. It uses a **critic-only reinforcement learning structure** along with an **augmented immune system model** and a **non-quadratic performance index** to determine optimal drug dosage levels. Simulation results demonstrate the approach's ability to balance effectiveness and safety in personalized medicine applications.

## 🩺 Problem Statement

Cancer treatment often requires precise drug dosage control. Overdosing can damage healthy cells, while underdosing may be ineffective. The challenge is further complicated by dynamic biological uncertainties and individual patient variability.

## ✅ Objectives

- Develop a robust drug dosage strategy using RL.
- Handle input constraints and immune system uncertainties.
- Ensure optimal tumor suppression while preserving immune cell counts.
- Implement the system using Java and simulate using tumor growth models.

## 🔍 Existing System

Current approaches rely on fixed models and dosage rules, which lack adaptability and personalization. While some systems use RL, they often overlook real-world constraints like input limits and unpredictable immune responses.

## 🚀 Proposed System

- **Reinforcement Learning-based Dosage Control**
- **Critic-only Structure for Optimal Policy Estimation**
- **Augmented Immune System Modeling**
- **Simulation for Validation on Multiple Tumor Growth Models**

## 🔒 Additional Features

- Incorporation of a **blockchain-based module** (optional extension) for securing medical data with:
  - Integrity
  - Authorization
  - Accountability
  - Non-repudiation
